Evidence lane for DESIGN-theme.

## Patterns

- **remote_theme distribution** — fleet sites never fork the theme, they consume it
- **one stylesheet** — DESIGN.css is universal across all surfaces
- **no content in theme** — content lives in fleet repos, theme provides structure only
- **Jekyll compilation** — no custom compilers, GitHub Pages native
